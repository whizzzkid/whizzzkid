### Namaste 🙏

I am a Full-Stack Developer currently working with AppDirect as a TechLead, specifically the AppDevices team which was earlier called AppCarousel and Wmode even before that. I am helping the team conquer a monolith by segregating the architecture into multiple manageable microservices. My interests are inclined towards performant WebApps, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Scene Understanding, you can find my [CV here](https://nishantarora.in/CV).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a bunch of Private projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to work with [clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp), [probot](https://probot.github.io/) and [HypriotOS](https://github.com/hypriot)
- 🤔 Why "Whizzzkid"? I was freelancing since 2009, Fiverr was just starting out then, I made my first account there in 2011, whizkid and whizzkid were taken, hence [whizzzkid](https://www.fiverr.com/whizzzkid). It just stuck!
