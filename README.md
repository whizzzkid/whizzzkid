### 🙏 Namaste

The world identifies me as Computer Scientist, Software Engineer, Software Developer (Oh Canada!), Programmer, etc. I am a builder 🏗️ at heart, my interests are inclined towards high performance WebApps, Distributed Systems, Decenteralized Systems, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Scene Understanding, you can find my [CV here](https://nishantarora.in/CV).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving my [Home Infrastructure](https://github.com/whizzzkid/home-infrastructure), it's humble but I bet it's more scalable than a lot of startups.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to work with [IPFS](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/InterPlanetary_File_System) and distributed design patterns.
- 🤔 Why "Whizzzkid"? I was freelancing since 2009, Fiverr was just starting out then, I made my first account there in 2011, whizkid and whizzkid were taken, hence [whizzzkid](https://www.fiverr.com/whizzzkid). It just stuck!
