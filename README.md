### Namaste 🙏

I am a Software Engineer currently building the next generation infrastructure to optimize growth channels at [Gusto](https://gusto.com/). My interests are inclined towards high performance WebApps, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Scene Understanding, you can find my [CV here](https://nishantarora.in/CV).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving my [Home Infrastructure](https://github.com/whizzzkid/home-infrastructure)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to work with [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and Typescript for Node.
- 🤔 Why "Whizzzkid"? I was freelancing since 2009, Fiverr was just starting out then, I made my first account there in 2011, whizkid and whizzkid were taken, hence [whizzzkid](https://www.fiverr.com/whizzzkid). It just stuck!
