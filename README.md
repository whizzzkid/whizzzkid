### 🙏 Namaste

The world identifies me as a Computer Scientist, a Software Engineer, or a Software Developer (Oh Canada!), etc. Trust me, I am just a builder 👷 who loves to build stuff 🏗️.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving my [Home Infrastructure](https://github.com/whizzzkid/home-infrastructure), it's modest but I bet it's more scalable than a lot of startups.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to work with [IPFS](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/InterPlanetary_File_System) and decentralized systems design patterns.

    - 🚀 High Performance Web-Apps
    - ✨ Distributed Systems
    - 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Decenteralized Systems
    - 🤖 Deep Learning

- 🤔 Why "Whizzzkid"? I have been freelancing since 2009, then Fiverr was just starting out then, I made my first account there in 2011, whizkid and whizzkid were taken, hence [whizzzkid](https://www.fiverr.com/whizzzkid). It just stuck!
